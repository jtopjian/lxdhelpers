# LXD Helpers

This repository contains helper functions for creating LXD-compatible client applications.

## Attribution and Credits

The functions in `certificates.go` are based on functions found in [lxd](https://github.com/lxc/lxd). Those original functions are not exported and thus cannot be consumed by other applications, hence their re-implementation here. Let this statement be official credit to the LXD project for the original work.
